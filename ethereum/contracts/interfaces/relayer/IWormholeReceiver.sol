     * @notice When a `send` is performed with this contract as the target, this function will be
     *     invoked by the WormholeRelayer contract
     *
     * NOTE: This function should be restricted such that only the Wormhole Relayer contract can call it.
     *
     * We also recommend that this function:
     *   - Stores all received `deliveryHash`s in a mapping `(bytes32 => bool)`, and
     *       on every call, checks that deliveryHash has not already been stored in the
     *       map (This is to prevent other users maliciously trying to relay the same message)
     *   - Checks that `sourceChain` and `sourceAddress` are indeed who
     *       you expect to have requested the calling of `send` on the source chain
     *
     * The invocation of this function corresponding to the `send` request will have msg.value equal
     *   to the receiverValue specified in the send request.
     *
     * If the invocation of this function reverts or exceeds the gas limit 
     *   specified by the send requester, this delivery will result in a `ReceiverFailure`.
     *
     * @param payload - an arbitrary message which was included in the delivery by the
     *     requester.
     * @param additionalVaas - Additional VAAs which were requested to be included in this delivery.
     *   They are guaranteed to all be included and in the same order as was specified in the
     *     delivery request.
     * @param sourceAddress - the (wormhole format) address on the sending chain which requested
     *     this delivery.
     * @param sourceChain - the wormhole chain ID where this delivery was requested.
     * @param deliveryHash - the VAA hash of the deliveryVAA.
     *
     * NOTE: These signedVaas are NOT verified by the Wormhole core contract prior to being provided
     *     to this call. Always make sure `parseAndVerify()` is called on the Wormhole core contract
     *     before trusting the content of a raw VAA, otherwise the VAA may be invalid or malicious.
