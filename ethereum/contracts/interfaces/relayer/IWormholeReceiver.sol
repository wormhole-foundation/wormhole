     *        (This is to prevent other users maliciously trying to relay the same message)
     *      - Checks that 'deliveryData.sourceChain' and 'deliveryData.sourceAddress' are indeed who you expect to have requested the calling of 'send' or 'forward' on the source chain
     *
     * The invocation of this function corresponding to the 'send' request will have msg.value equal to the receiverValue specified in the send request.
     *
     * If the invocation of this function reverts or exceeds the gasLimit (maxTransactionFee) specified by the send requester, this delivery will result in a ReceiverFailure.

     * NOTE: These signedVaas are NOT verified by the Wormhole core contract prior to being provided to this call.
     * Always make sure parseAndVerify is called on the Wormhole core contract before trusting the content of a raw VAA,
     * otherwise the VAA may be invalid or malicious.
