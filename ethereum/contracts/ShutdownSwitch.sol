/**
 * @dev Abstract contract module that provides a bridge contract with the ability to temporarily suspend transfers.
 *
 * Inheriting from `ShutdownSwitch` will allow a bridge contract to use the isEnabled modifier to prevent transactions
 * when the shutdown switch is engaged via a guardian voting mechanism.
 *
 * This contract provides a public function that allows the guardians to vote to disable / enable transfers.
 * When a predetermined number of guardians vote to disable, then transfers are blocked until the number of
 * disable votes is reduced below that threshold.
 *
 * NOTE: The number of votes to enable is irrelevant. As long as there are enough votes to disable, transfers are blocked.
 *
 * An important design goal of this implementation is to minimize the impact (gas) to users, so the check to determine
 * if transfers are enabled is a simple boolean check.
 *
 * The shutdown status is only updated when a vote is cast. When that happens, this contract gets the current guardian set.
 * It validates that the vote is for an active guardian. If so, it updates their vote, counts the number of
 * votes to disable, and updates the shutdown status.
 *
 * Votes are cast using an authorization proof that is unique to each guardian and the wallet public key used to generate
 * the proof. That wallet should be different from the guardian's private key. When a guardian casts a vote, it must be sent
 * from that wallet.
 *
 * The authorization proof is generated using the wallet public key and the guardian private key. When a vote is cast,
 * the code uses the authorization proof and the message sender (wallet public key) to recover the guardian public key.
 * That is compared to the current list of active guardians, and if a match is found, then the vote is valid.
 *
 * NOTE: The status is updated when any active guardian casts a vote, whether it changes anything or not. This means that,
 * after a guardian set update, the shutdown status can be updated by casting an enable vote when you are already enabled.
 *
 * This contract provides public getters to query the shutdown status. It also emits events when valid votes are cast,
 * or the shutdown status changes.
