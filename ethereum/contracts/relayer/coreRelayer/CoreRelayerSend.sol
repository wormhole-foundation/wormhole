     *  as well as a maximum transaction fee refund equal to or greater than the original delivery.
     *  @param newReceiverValue - the receiveValue (in this chain's wei) that should be used on the redelivery. Must result in receiverValue on the target chain which is equal to or greater that the original delivery.
     *  @param targetChain - the chain which the original delivery targetted.
