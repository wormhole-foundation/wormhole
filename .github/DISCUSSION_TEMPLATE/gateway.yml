        - Please include specific use cases for Wormhole messaging and/or token bridging, as many metrics as possible, and other details such as:
        - **Light lift for Guardians** - Guardians are not required to run a full node for <chain> - connectivity will be via a Gateway IBC connection.
        - Other bridges that are already connected to the network.
        - Details and specific metrics about the ecosystem (dApps, users, etc).
        - Details about how your chain will use Wormhole messaging or token bridging.
        - Details around incentivized liquidity programs (if any) for your chain's native token and/or Wormhole-wrapped tokens.

      value: |
        If there are no extra requirements for guardians, please use the message below: 
        None - [chain] will emit messages to Gateway via IBC. Guardians should not have to run anything additional (except for guardians who may run IBC relayers).

      value: |
        Please describe how IBC relaying between Wormhole Gateway and your chain will be handled.
        - Are you asking one of the Wormhole Guardians to handle IBC relaying?
        - Do you already have an IBC relaying provider who is not a Wormhole Guardian? If so, please include as much information as possible on who they are and what kind of service agreement you have with them.

      value: |
        Wormhole marquee UIs such as [Portal Bridge](https://portalbridge.com/) and [Connect](https://wormhole.com/connect/) require dedicated RPCs to provide the best user experience. We ask that you coordinate with an RPC provider to set these up for the Wormhole UIs to use.
