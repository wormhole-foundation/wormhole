You are solely responsible for using the Materials in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to, export control or sanctions laws of any applicable jurisdiction. You should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the Specially Designated Nationals list. Accordingly, you must avoid providing the Materials to sanctioned persons because such activity could be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law.
