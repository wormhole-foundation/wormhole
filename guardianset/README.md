These files document historic guardian set changes. 

Wormhole Core contract deployments that are set to a particular guardian set index only accept VAAs that are signed by a quorum of entities in that set.

The VAAs that guardian sets had signed to approve the next guardian set are stored in deployments/mainnet/guardianSetVAAs.csv
