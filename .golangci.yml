      #   Use an exclamation mark `!` to negate a variable.
      #   Example: `!$test` matches any file that is not a go test file.
      #
      #   `$all` - matches all go files
      #   `$test` - matches all go test files

      # - Package Variables
      #
      #   `$gostd` - matches all of go's standard library (Pulled from `GOROOT`)
