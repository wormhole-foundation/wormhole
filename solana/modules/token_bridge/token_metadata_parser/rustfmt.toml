# Override parent rustfmt.toml since this crate uses stable Rust
# The parent uses nightly-only features that aren't available in stable:
# - imports_granularity = "Crate"
# - imports_layout = "Vertical"
# - empty_item_single_line = false
#
# This file intentionally left empty to use default stable rustfmt settings
