/// This module implements upgradeability for the token bridge contract.
///
/// Contract upgrades are authorised by governance, which means that performing
/// an upgrade requires a governance VAA signed by a supermajority of the
/// wormhole guardians.
///
/// Upgrades are performed in a commit-reveal scheme, where submitting the VAA
/// authorises a particular contract hash. Then in a subsequent transaction, the
/// bytecode is uploaded, and if the hash of the bytecode matches the committed
/// hash, then the upgrade proceeds.
///
/// This two-phase process has the advantage that even if the bytecode can't be
/// upgraded to for whatever reason, the governance VAA won't be possible to
/// replay in the future, since the commit transaction replay protects it.
///
/// Additionally, there is an optional migration step that may include one-off
/// logic to be executed after the upgrade. This has to be done in a separate
/// transaction, because the transaction that uploads bytecode cannot execute
/// it.
