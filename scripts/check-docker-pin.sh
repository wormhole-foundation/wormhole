# This script is checks to that all our Docker images are pinned to a specific SHA256 hash
#
# References as to why...
#   - https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-18-please-pin-your-docker-image-versions
#   - https://snyk.io/blog/10-docker-image-security-best-practices/ (Specifically: USE FIXED TAGS FOR IMMUTABILITY)
#
# Explaination of regex ignore choices
#   - We ignore sha256 because it suggests that the image dep is pinned
#   - We ignore scratch because it's literally the docker base image
#   - We ignore solana AS (builder|ci_tests) because it's a relative reference to another FROM call
#
git ls-files | grep "Dockerfile*" | xargs grep -s "FROM" | egrep -v 'sha256|scratch|solana AS (builder|ci_tests)'
