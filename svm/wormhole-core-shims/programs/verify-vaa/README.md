# Verify VAA Shim

# Objective

Reduce the cost of Core Bridge message verification on Solana. Provide a new verification mechanism without making changes to the existing core bridge.

# **Background**

The current way most integrators on Solana verify VAAs is via the following process.

1. Call `createSecp256k1Instruction` (native instruction) and [`verify_signatures`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/db1ee86bfbaf16383c46150a44b1437a522514da/solana/bridge/program/src/api/verify_signature.rs#L67) on the Core bridge, potentially multiple times, in order to verify and store all of the signatures from the VAA into a signature set account, as the signature data for 13 signatures is too long to fit into a single transaction. (There used to be a compute unit restriction as well, but that is no longer an issue as a higher limit can now be requested.)
2. Call [`post_vaa`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/db1ee86bfbaf16383c46150a44b1437a522514da/solana/bridge/program/src/api/post_vaa.rs#L102) on the Core bridge in order to validate the signature set account against the VAA and post the VAA data into an account.
3. Call some instruction on your program which takes a posted VAA account and assumes its validity.

Notably, the signature set account is not closed, nor is the posted VAA account, and there exists no mechanism to close them either. This means that posters permanently lose the lamports dedicated to the rent exemption for these accounts.

However, some integrations, such as [Solana World ID](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/solana-world-id-program/tree/main) use a different approach:

1. Call [`post_signatures`](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/solana-world-id-program/blob/68f1740b2b9bad9d86bd933001a3716a2a993930/programs/solana-world-id-program/src/instructions/post_signatures.rs#L46) on your program, potentially multiple times, in order to store the signature data on-chain in a guardian signatures account.
2. Call some instruction on your program which takes a [Core bridge guardian set](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/solana-world-id-program/blob/68f1740b2b9bad9d86bd933001a3716a2a993930/programs/solana-world-id-program/src/instructions/update_root_with_query.rs#L70) account, the [guardian signatures](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/solana-world-id-program/blob/68f1740b2b9bad9d86bd933001a3716a2a993930/programs/solana-world-id-program/src/instructions/update_root_with_query.rs#L74) account, and [performs the required checks and verification](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/solana-world-id-program/blob/68f1740b2b9bad9d86bd933001a3716a2a993930/programs/solana-world-id-program/src/instructions/update_root_with_query.rs#L113). If the verification is successful, it performs whatever action is needed and closes the signatures account, refunding the lamports.

This approach does not require leaving any on-chain artifacts and is more cost effective. Part of the reason this is now possible in less instructions is due to the `secp256k1_recover` syscall and ability to increase the compute unit budget.

> ðŸ’¡ This will also provide integrators the flexibility to post the VAA payload separately as well if needed for payloads that wonâ€™t fit into a transaction.

# **Goals**

- Recommend a documented mechanism for verifying VAAs which does not require permanently storing accounts.
- Provide a reusable approach to perform the bulk of the work, as possible.
- Provide a cost savings estimation compared to the `post_vaa` approach.

# Non-Goals

- Provide an on-chain program which generates an artifact of verification, akin to `post_vaa`.

# **Overview**

Save end-user costs on Solana VAA verification by providing a shim which integrators can CPI call to perform verification. This shim will allow the client to clean up any artifacts generated during the verification process, ultimately resulting in a lower cost verification.

# Detailed Design

## Technical Details

The shim will have three instructions which can be leveraged over two transactions, resulting in less transactions and rent costs than the core bridge approach.

This explicitly takes only operates on the signatures, guardian set, and digest, making it compatible with both v1 VAAs and Queries while maintaining a static instruction size for verification.

As a bonus, this also allows for verification of VAA bodies that are larger than can fit in a single instruction, which was not possible with the existing core bridge. Integrators can pass the VAA body via instruction data or account, as suits their needs. How they choose to do so is outside the scope of this design.

### Post Signatures

Creates or appends to a GuardianSignatures account for subsequent use by verify_vaa. This is necessary as the Wormhole VAA body, which has an arbitrary size, and 13 guardian signatures (a quorum of the current 19 mainnet guardians, 66 bytes each) alongside the required accounts is likely larger than the transaction size limit on Solana (1232 bytes). This will also allow for the verification of other messages which guardians sign, such as QueryResults.

This instruction allows for the initial payer to append additional signatures to the account by calling the instruction again. This may be necessary if a quorum of signatures from the current guardian set grows larger than can fit into a single transaction.

The GuardianSignatures account can be closed by the initial payer via close_signatures, which will refund the initial payer.

### Verify VAA

This instruction is intended to be invoked via CPI call. It verifies a digest against a GuardianSignatures account and a core bridge GuardianSet. Prior to this call, and likely in a separate transaction, `post_signatures` must be called to create the account. Immediately after this call, `close_signatures` should be called to reclaim the lamports.

A v1 VAA digest can be computed as follows:

```rust
let message_hash = &solana_program::keccak::hashv(&[&vaa_body]).to_bytes();
let digest = keccak::hash(message_hash.as_slice()).to_bytes();
```

A QueryResponse digest can be computed as follows:

```rust
use wormhole_query_sdk::MESSAGE_PREFIX;
let message_hash = [
  MESSAGE_PREFIX,
  &solana_program::keccak::hashv(&[&bytes]).to_bytes(),
]
.concat();
let digest = keccak::hash(message_hash.as_slice()).to_bytes();
```

### Close Signatures

Allows the initial payer to close the signature account, reclaiming the rent taken by `post_signatures`.

## Protocol Integration

There are no changes required to the protocol.

# **Caveats**

This shim will need to include the following patch made to the core bridge when calculating the expiry for guardian sets.

```rust
pub fn is_active(&self, timestamp: &u32) -> bool {
    // Note: This is a fix for Wormhole on mainnet.  The initial guardian set was never expired
    // so we block it here.
    if self.index == 0 && self.creation_time == 1628099186 {
        false
    } else {
        self.expiration_time == 0 || self.expiration_time >= *timestamp
    }
}
```

Unlike the core bridge, it will not need to perform signature set deny-listing, as it does the verification directly through `secp256k1_recover`.

Since it is planned to be non-upgradeable, any similar mitigation strategies will not be possible. e.g. the only way to expire a guardian set will be for the core bridge to properly expire it.

# **Alternatives Considered**

- Integrators perform verification logic themselves - this design does not prohibit integrators from doing this and having each integrator implement verification in their own program is a significant amount of code duplication to recommend. The purpose here is to provide an easy mechanism for integrators to verify VAAs.
- Post VAA data to an account - for some integrators, the VAA body may fit into their instruction data, so avoiding the account would save cost and added complexity. For integrators with larger payloads, they can first post the body into an account and process it in a subsequent instruction. They may have other efficiencies to gain in how they do that, such as automatically closing the account after verifying the VAA and performing the desired action, so it seemed best to leave this up to the integrator.
- Provide an artifact of verification, akin to the core bridgeâ€™s `post_vaa` - while this has the advantage of using only 1 account instead of 3, it has the disadvantage of being another temporary account to clean up _and_ does not enforce that the VAA is _currently_ valid, but rather that it was at some time in the past. Since the advent of [Address Lookup Tables](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/lookup-tables), using more accounts is less of an issue than it once was, and ensuring that the VAA is actually valid when you consume it is a security gain.

# **Security Considerations**

See Caveats.

After initial testing is complete and proper configuration and functionality of the shim is confirmed, the upgrade authority should be discarded in order to improve trust assumptions and avoid possible compromise of the key.

# Test Plan

Gas cost analysis should be performed for verifying VAAs with and without the shim.

# Performance Impact

This should greatly reduce the cost of verifying messages on Solana, as it will save the current rent exemption cost per signature set and posted VAA account.

It does, however, increase the compute units required by using `secp256k1_recover` instead of the native instruction.

That is ~200k CU for ~.3% of the cost.

# Rollout

This only requires deployment of the shim Solana program. If desired, upgrade authority of the shim can be maintained for a limited time while testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

Test that verifying a valid VAA digest and signatures via the shimâ€™s `verify_vaa` succeeds. Test that an expired guardian set, incorrect digest, bad signatures, etc, fail.
