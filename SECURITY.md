# Security

## Bug Bounty Program

We operate a **[bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/wormhole/)** to financially incentivize independent researchers (with up to $10,000,000 USDC) to find and responsibly disclose security issues in Wormhole.

If you find a security issue in wormhole, we ask that you immediately **[report the bug](https://immunefi.com/bounty/wormhole/)** to our security team.

## 3rd Party Security Audits

We engage 3rd party firms to conduct independent security audits of Wormhole.  At any given time, we likely have multiple audit streams in progress.

As these 3rd party audits are completed and issues are sufficiently addressed, we make those audit reports public.
