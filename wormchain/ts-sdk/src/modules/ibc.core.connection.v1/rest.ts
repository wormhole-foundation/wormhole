/**
* `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

    Foo foo = ...;
    Any any;
    any.PackFrom(foo);
    ...
    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
      ...
    }

Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

    Foo foo = ...;
    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
    ...
    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
    }

 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

    foo = Foo(...)
    any = Any()
    any.Pack(foo)
    ...
    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
      any.Unpack(foo)
      ...

 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
     if err != nil {
       ...
     }
     ...
     foo := &pb.Foo{}
     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
       ...
     }

The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
name "y.z".


JSON
====
The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

    package google.profile;
    message Person {
      string first_name = 1;
      string last_name = 2;
    }

    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
      "firstName": <string>,
      "lastName": <string>
    }

If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

    {
      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
      "value": "1.212s"
    }
*/
export interface ProtobufAny {
  /**
   * A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
   * protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
   * one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
   * the fully qualified name of the type (as in
   * `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
   * (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
   *
   * In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
   * expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
   * scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
   * server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
   * * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
   * * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
   *   value in binary format, or produce an error.
   * * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
   *   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
   *   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
   *   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
   *   breaking changes.)
   * Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
   * protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
   * type.googleapis.com.
   * Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
   * used with implementation specific semantics.
