------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program verifies a subset of the signatures in a VAA against the guardian set. This
program works in tandem with the VAA Processor stateful program.

The difference between this version and the Randlabs version is I removed most of the asserts
since we are going to have to completely validate the arguments again in the
TokenBridge contract.

We also cannot retroactively see/verify what arguments were passed into this
function unless all the arguments are in the Txn.application_args so
everything has to get moved out of the lsig args and into the txn_args

    Verifies some signatures of a VAA. Due to computation budget limitations,
    this can't verify all signatures in one go. Instead, it just makes sure that
    whatever signatures it's given correspond to the given keys.

    In addition, none of the arguments are validated here beyond the fact that
    the signatures are valid given the keys and the message hash. In particular,
    the message hash is also not validated here. Thus, the proper way to use
    this function is by calling it (by the client) before the token bridge
    program.  Then the token bridge program verify each input + that the right
    program was called. If it failed to verify any of these, then signature
    verification could be bypaseed.
