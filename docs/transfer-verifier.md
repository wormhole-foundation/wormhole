# Transfer Verifier

Below are admin controls for the Guardians to configure the Transfer Verifier plugin. For
a background on the feature and its objectives, see [the whitepaper](whitepapers/0014_transfer_verifier.md)

## How To Enable Transfer Verifier
The Transfer Verifier feature is disabled by default. Guardians can enable it by passing the following flag to the `guardiand` command when starting it up:

```bash
# Enable Transfer Verifier for chain with ID 2 (Ethereum)
--transferVerifierEnabledChainIDs=2
```

This parameter is a comma-separated list of Wormhole Chain IDs for which transfer verification will be enabled.

Only some chains support the Transfer Verifier.
